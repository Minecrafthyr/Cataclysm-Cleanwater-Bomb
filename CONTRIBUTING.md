## 使用一个好编辑器

《Cataclysm: Cleanwater Bomb》的大部分游戏数据都定义在 JSON 文件中。

这些文件的设计初衷是便于你编辑，但其中存在一些陷阱。使用 Windows 记事本可能会带来麻烦，因为它会在文件开头插入一个名为 [BOM](https://baike.baidu.com/item/BOM/2790364) 的特殊字符，而 CCB 并不需要这个字符。

如果你打算编辑 JSON 文件，建议使用功能更全面的编辑器，例如 [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 或 [Zed](https://zed.dev/)。

## 拉取请求的“概述 (Summary)”段落

“概述”是对你所做更改的一行描述，该描述将被提取并添加到[项目变更日志](./data/changelog.txt)中。格式如下：

```markdown
#### 概述 (Summary)
分类“描述”
```

可选的分类包括：特性、内容、界面、模组、平衡、错误修复、性能优化、基础设施、构建、国际化。

```markdown
#### 概述 (Summary)
内容“新增突变类别‘Mouse’”
```

若你认为那是一个小更改，无需在变更日志中出现，可删除“概述”段落。

有关各分类的说明，请参阅[更新日志指南](./doc/CHANGELOG_GUIDELINES.md)。

## 通过 GitHub 贡献

### 文档添加指南 (Guidelines for adding documentation)

* Doxygen comments should describe behavior towards the outside, not implementation, but since many classes in Cataclysm are intertwined, it's often necessary to describe implementation.
* Describe things that aren't obvious just from the name.
* Don't describe redundantly: `/** Map **/; map* map;` is not a helpful comment.
* When documenting X, describe how X interacts with other components, not just what X itself does.

### 本地构建以浏览文档 (Building the documentation for viewing it locally)

* Install doxygen
* `doxygen doxygen_doc/doxygen_conf.txt `
* `firefox doxygen_doc/html/index.html` (replace firefox with your browser of choice)

## Example Workflow

***TODO: change needed here for a example workflow***

#### Setup your environment

*(This only needs to be done once.)*

1. [Fork](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/fork) this repository here on GitHub.

**Note:** Fork is different from branch, branches are covered [later](#make-your-changes).

2. Clone your fork locally.

    ```bash
    # Clones your fork of the repository into the current directory in terminal
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Cataclysm-DDA.git
    # Alternatively if you don't want to clone an entire big history (5GB!)
    $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Cataclysm-DDA.git
    ```

3. Set commit message template.

    ```bash
    # Changes the active directory in the prompt to the newly cloned "Cataclysm-DDA" directory
    $ cd Cataclysm-DDA
    # Set commit message template to the custom one in the repo
    $ git config --local commit.template .gitmessage
    ```

4. Add this repository as a remote.

    ```bash
    # Assigns the original repository to a remote called "upstream"
    $ git remote add -f upstream https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA.git
    ```

- [chris.beams.io](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)

#### Update your `master` branch

1. Make sure you have your `master` branch checked out.

```bash
$ git checkout master
```

2. Pull the changes from the `upstream/master` branch.

```bash
$ git pull --ff-only upstream master
# gets changes from "master" branch on the "upstream" remote
```

 * Note: If this gives you an error, it means you have committed directly to your local `master` branch. [Click here for instructions on how to fix this issue](#why-does-git-pull---ff-only-result-in-an-error).

3. Pull new tags from the `upstream` remote repo.

This step is not necessary to compile or contribute, but skipping it can result in outdated version numbers on your builds.

```bash
$ git fetch upstream --tags
# gets new tags from the "upstream" remote
```

4. Optionally, push the synced master state to the `origin/master` branch.

```bash
$ git push origin master
# push the synced master state to your fork
```

#### Make your changes

0. Update your `master` branch, if you haven't already.

1. For each new feature or bug fix, create a new branch.

```bash
# Creates a new branch called "new_feature" and switches to it
$ git checkout -b new_feature
```

2. Once you've committed some changes locally, you need to push them to your fork here on GitHub.

```bash
# origin was automatically set to point to your fork when you cloned it
$ git push origin new_feature
```

3. Once you're finished working on your branch, and have committed and pushed all your changes, submit a pull request from your `new_feature` branch to this repository's `master` branch.

 * Note: any new commits to the `new_feature` branch on GitHub will automatically be included in the pull request, so make sure to only commit related changes to the same branch.

## 草稿 (Drafts)

如果你提交了 PR 但仍在处理中，请将其设为 [草稿](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)。

![截图](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pullrequest-send.png)

这将告知审阅者你仍计划对 PR 进行补充，我们暂时无需进行审阅。当拉取请求准备好接受合并审核时，只需点击 [`Ready for review`](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) 按钮。

![截图](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/ready-for-review-button.png)

这样可以让我们只审核已准备就绪的内容，从而加快审核流程，并有助于避免合并尚未完全准备好的内容。

### 征求意见

如果你还希望寻求建议，请在标题前添加 [CR] 或 [征求意见]。当你认为已获得足够信息可以继续时，请随时移除 [CR]。

提交 PR 时，无需解决或引用未解决的问题，但若你这样做了，则需详细说明你的 PR 正在解决的问题。

每次在讨论或进一步思考后更改分支时，请确保你的 PR 描述仍然与当前内容相关。

### 使用关键词关闭问题

* resolved

## Tooling support

***TODO: change needed here for a example workflow***

Various tools are available to help you keep your contributions conforming to the appropriate style. See [DEVELOPER_TOOLING.md](./doc/c++/DEVELOPER_TOOLING.md) for more details.

## Advanced Techniques

These guidelines aren't essential, but they can make keeping things in order much easier.

#### Using remote tracking branches

Remote tracking branches allow you to easily stay in touch with this repository's `master` branch, as they automatically know which remote branch to get changes from.

```bash
$ git branch -vv
* master      xxxx [origin/master] ....
  new_feature xxxx ....
```

Here you can see we have two branches; `master` which is tracking `origin/master`, and `new_feature` which isn't tracking any branch. In practice, what this means is that git won't know where to get changes from.

```bash
$ git checkout new_feature
Switched to branch 'new_feature'
$ git pull
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
```

In order to easily pull changes from `upstream/master` into the `new_feature` branch, we can tell git which branch it should track. (You can even do this for your local master branch.)

```bash
$ git branch -u upstream/master new_feature
Branch new_feature set up to track remote branch master from upstream.
$ git pull
Updating xxxx..xxxx
....
```

You can also set the tracking information at the same time as creating the branch.

    $ git branch new_feature_2 --track upstream/master
    Branch new_feature_2 set up to track remote branch master from upstream.

 * Note: Although this makes it easier to pull from `upstream/master`, it doesn't change anything with regards to pushing. `git push` fails because you don't have permission to push to `upstream/master`.

    ```bash
    $ git push
    error: The requested URL returned error: 403 while accessing https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA.git
    fatal: HTTP request failed
    $ git push origin
    ....
    To https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Cataclysm-DDA.git
    xxxx..xxxx  new_feature -> new_feature
    ```

## Unit tests

***TODO: change needed here for a example workflow***

There is a suite of tests built into the source tree at tests/  
You should run the test suite after ANY change to the game source.  
An ordinary invocation of `make` will build the test executable at `tests/cata_test`, and it can be invoked like any ordinary executable, or via `make check`.
Running `tests/cata_test` with no arguments will run the entire test suite; running it with `--help` will print a number of invocation options you can use to adjust its operation.

```bash
$ make
... compilation details ...
$ tests/cata_test
Starting the actual test at Fri Nov  9 04:37:03 2018
===============================================================================
All tests passed (1324684 assertions in 94 test cases)
Ended test at Fri Nov  9 04:37:45 2018
The test took 41.772 seconds
```

It is recommended to habitually invoke make like ``make YOUR BUILD OPTIONS && make check``.

If you're working with Visual Studio (and don't have `make`), see [Visual Studio-specific advice](./doc/c++/COMPILING-VS-VCPKG.md#running-unit-tests).

If you want/need to add a test, see [TESTING.md](./doc/c++/TESTING.md)

## In-game testing, test environment and the debug menu

***TODO: change needed here: OUTDATED, waiting for CDDA update this section***

Whether you are implementing a new feature or whether you are fixing a bug, it is always a good practice to test your changes in-game. It can be a hard task to create the exact conditions by playing a normal game to be able to test your changes, which is why there is a debug menu. There is no default key to bring up the menu so you will need to assign one first.

Bring up the keybindings menu (press `Escape` then `1`), scroll down almost to the bottom and press `+` to add a new keybinding. Press the letter that corresponds to the *Debug menu* item, then press the key you want to use to bring up the debug menu. To test your changes, create a new world with a new character. Once you are in that world, press the key you just assigned for the debug menu and you should see:

```

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

With the commands in this menu, you should be able to recreate the proper conditions to test your changes.  Most commands change one thing at a time.

The last command, "Quick setup", does many things at once:
* Gives you debug traits such as clairvoyance, invincibility, near infinite stamina and mana, etc
* Gives you a nearly infinite backpack
* Maxes your skills (but not your stats!)
* Reveals the map

### Debug names

If you name a character starting with one of "Debug", "Test", "Sandbox", "Staging", "QA", or "UAT", they will spawn with the debug quick setup performed automatically.

If you name a world one of those names, every character will spawn that way.

## Frequently Asked Questions

***TODO: change needed here: who asked? CCB doesn't get asked. Replace by a real asked problem.***

#### Why does `git pull --ff-only` result in an error?

If `git pull --ff-only` shows an error, it means that you've committed directly to your local `master` branch. To fix this, we create a new branch with these commits, find the point at which we diverged from `upstream/master`, and then reset `master` to that point.

```bash
$ git pull --ff-only upstream master
From https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
$ git branch new_branch master          # mark the current commit with a tmp branch
$ git merge-base master upstream/master
cc31d0... # the last commit before we committed directly to master
$ git reset --hard cc31d0....
HEAD is now at cc31d0... ...
```

Now that `master` has been cleaned up, we can easily pull from `upstream/master`, and then continue working on `new_branch`.

```bash
$ git pull --ff-only upstream master
# gets changes from the "upstream" remote for the matching branch, in this case "master"
$ git checkout new_branch
```

#### Oh no! I've made my changes to `master` branch and have pushed it to my repo! What should I do now?
Assuming `upstream` is `CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA` and `origin` is your fork, do the commands:
```bash
git reset upstream/master
git push --repo=origin --force
```

For more frequently asked questions, see the [developer FAQ](./doc/DEVELOPER_FAQ.md).
